# FinalGroupProject
* Pick two object-oriented languages.
* Form a team to work on the comparison.
  * You can be a team of 1.
  * Teams greater than 4 are usually not a good idea.
* Using the comparison criteria provided, compare the two languages
* through documentation and code examples.
* The documentation is to be written in markdown.
* The documentation and code examples are to be in a
* GitHub public repository that the team uses.
* The home page is to be the README.md for the repository.
* Other mark down pages can be linked using relative links in markdown files.
  * Relative links in markdown files (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..
* The README.md is to include near the top:
  * The two languages being compared.
  * The names of the members of the team.
* The URL for the GitHub repository for your team is to be submitted via an assignment on Canvas.
# Comparison Criteria
* Language purpose/genesis
  * Why was the language created?
  * What problems was the language trying to address?
  * Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
* Unique features of the language
  * Does the language have any particularly unique features?
* Name spaces
  * How are name spaces implemented?
  * How are name spaces used?
* Types
  * What types does the language support?
  * Are both reference and value types supported?
  * Can new value types be created?
* Classes
  * Defining
  * Creating new instances
  * Constructing/initializing
  * Destructing/de-initializing
* Instance reference name in data type (class)
  * this? self?
* Properties
  * Getters and settersâ€¦write your own or built in?
  * Backing variables?
  * Computed properties?
* Interfaces / protocols
  * What does the language support?
  * What abilities does it have?
  * How is it used?
* Inheritance / extension
* Reflection
  * What reflection abilities are supported?
  * How is reflection used?
* Memory management
  * How is it handled?
  * How does it work?
  * Garbage collection?
  * Automatic reference counting?
* Comparisons of references and values
  * How are values compared? (i.e. comparing two strings)
* Null/nil references
  * Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)
  * Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?
* Errors and exception handling
* Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types

## Implementation of listeners and event handlers
A basic implementation of a handler (onClick function) and a listener (onClickListener) in Kotlin is much shorter than in Java as shown below.

##### Java
```java

public interface OnClickListener{
  void onClick(View v);
}

button.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener(){
  @Override
  public void onClick(View v){
    doSomething();
  }
});
```
##### Kotlin
```kotlin
button.setOnClickListener(object : OnClickListener{
  override fun onClick(view: View){
    doSomething()
  }
})
```
Notice that in Kotlin it is very similar to Java, we create an object of interface OnClickListener and define a method that overrides onClick. However in Kotlin it can be even less code if we choose to use Kotlin's ability to substitute a function that recieves an interface with a lambda
##### Kotlin with lambda

```kotlin
fun setOnClickListener(listener: (View) -> Unit)

button.setOnClickListener({ view -> doSomething() })
```

## Singleton
  * How is a singleton implemented?
  * Can it be made thread-safe?
  * Can the singleton instance be lazily instantiated?
## Procedural programming
  Kotlin supports procedural programming. In Kotlin you may start coding a function without encapsulating it, which Java does not allow. The following is the classic "hello world" program first in a Java class and then In Kotlin using procedural programming.
  ##### Java

  ```java
  public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }

}
```
  
##### Kotlin

  ```kotlin
  fun main(args : Array<String>) {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```
  
## Functional programming
Kotlin also supports functional programming.
## Multithreading
  * Threads or thread-like abilities
  * How is multitasking accomplished?
